# Custom styles for Pivotal tracker

## Why

Because I look at Pivotal a lot.

## Requirements

* [Stylebot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha) for Chrome
* Only tested on [Chrome Canary](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/chromesxs). Is probably fine on [normal Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome). Probably.

## Notes

* Make sure you only apply this style to www.pivotaltracker.com/projects so that it doesn't affect other parts of the site (e.g. login)
